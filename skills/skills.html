                <p> Learning about web, webpages and the other web stuff like SEO brings me here, to the front-end developer path. All of it started when I decided to be a webmaster but in time, building pages is my goal!</p>

                <p> As a mechanical engeineering student I can't forget about everything I have learned on my studies. All technical stuff like computer programs and technical drawings are something I really like.</p>

                <p> Other thing  I really like is data analysis. It began with passion for web optymalizations, then I started to learn spreedsheets and a little of SQL. I think it is great!
